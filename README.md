# Maximum-Spanning-Tree
Maximum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm

### Dataset
use DBLP dataset from the following link.

### Steps
    1. Create a graph representation from a file that has 3 columns, first two columns
    represent author id and third represents the weight of the link. Edge weight is
    proportional to the amount of collaboration (bigger means collaborating quite
    frequently)
    2. Create a Maximum spanning tree from the graph created in (1) . This represents the
    top collaborators of each researcher.
    3. By using the maximum spanning tree generated in (2) enumerate the top 5 distinct
    collaborator pairs.
